time 2015-06-16T10:43:11Z author CONTRIBUTOR repo 10up/ElasticPress title remove suppress all query filters during an index operation body discovered a massive issue with the tribe events calendar that occurred during a bulk index operation. the events calendar has a filter on parse_query that adds some very heavy if logic to the mysql request. this not only slows down the indexing operation but can potentially fill up the mysqltmp file and crash the db server. taking this a step further i began to wonder when would we want to allow the queries of the index operations to be filterable at all? could should we remove all filters via the remove_filter command from filters? when i did this i noticed the indexing operation for 20k posts went _significantly_ faster then i had ever seen it happen. this warrants some discussion but i wanted to raise the question to get some input. cc tlovett1,1

time 2021-04-03T04:59:28Z author CONTRIBUTOR repo 14ercooper/14erEdit title functions add argcount and setarg body functions would be made significantly easier to use if they asked for a certain number of arguments instead of having to give them in the command line itself. not only that having a command to set a certain number of arguments would allow for default arguments by setting them above the argcount command. for instance argcount 2 setarg 0 0 setarg 1 14 would override player input setting the template variables to 0 and 14 no matter what a player inputted. this would be useful for longer functions overriding those template variables. however this instance setarg 0 0 setarg 1 14 argcount 2 might create 2 defaults before asking for 2 player given arguments. this way using 1 command we can 1. avoid the extra confusion of having to input an extra number into the command line an issue not present with templates and multibrushes 2. create default allowing for more versatility from functions and from a skilled coder a smaller change of breaking or even more detailed errors 3.,1

time 2020-12-31T10:02:20Z author MEMBER repo 30-seconds/30-seconds-web title migrate content configurations to a git submodule body our growing needs in terms of configuration seem to indicate a need to separate configuration from platform otherwise we run the risk of cluttering commit history with content related updates and triggering unnecessary rebuilds every so often. we can create a repository 30 seconds content to move configurations there and decouple them from platform development. the submodule should replace the content configs directory in itself initially. a future update might see general purpose assets such as blog images moved to the 30 seconds content repository to enable a more globalized and better maintained approach for them. _we'll tag this as an epic as the process for this might require unexpected changes and can potentially impact development of other features in the meanwhile._,1

time 2021-02-08T10:35:31Z author CONTRIBUTOR repo 3drepo/3drepobouncer title texture coordinates not considered by geometrycollector when matching vertices body in the geometrycollector addface method the geometrycollector will generate face indices by matching the face vertices to existing ones based on their content. this method takes uv coordinates as arguments but only considers position and normal attributes when matching. this creates the possibility that two or more vertices with different uvs but the same position normals degenerate to one of them and the uv coordinates of the others are lost. in practice this is very unlikely because two vertices with the same position and normals but different uvs would mean a uv seam on a planar surface which would be a very odd choice when unwrapping uvs either automatically or manually.,0

time 2021-03-19T20:10:19Z author NONE repo 3rdIteration/btcrecover title fails to handle large electrum wallet body i was testing btcrecover on encrypted electrum wallet files just to see how things worked. i have a large wallet file 104kb lots of transaction history with a known password and btcrecover was unable to open it. i put parts of the password in the tokenlist and set a low max tokens . i did some more tests and determined that if i loaded the wallet without a server to create a small file no history then btcrecover worked on it. but if i take the same file connect to an electrum server and it gets updated with history then btcrecover no longer works on it. my guess is that some code that is doing a quick evaluation on the decrypt is not handling the case of a large amount of data. this is using the latest version from github now.,0
